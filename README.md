### From Github releases

You can download installation resources for both Firefox and Chrome/edge browsers (zip, xpi, crx) from the [release page](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth-WebExtension/releases).  
Once downloaded, open the extension manager of your browser and drop the downloaded file to install the extension.

## Development

### Requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.com) (v22 min.)
- [NPM](https://npmjs.com)

### Install js dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

### Dev env

The extension uses the [WXT](https://wxt.dev/) web extension framework.
It allows Hot Module Replacement (HMR), cross-browser compatibility for the manifest file, automatic browser startup and more.

Simply run `npm run dev` in a terminal to launch a new browser (default is Chrome) and start working on the extension code. See package.json `scripts` section for other available commands.

#### Custom browser binaries

You can specify the browser binaries to use when running `npm run dev`. Rename `web-ext.config.ts.template` to `web-ext.config.ts` and edit the file to suit your needs.

#### Enable vue devTools

The standalone [@vue/devtools](https://devtools.vuejs.org/) app comes as an npm dev dependency. Run `./node_modules/.bin/vue-devtools` in a terminal to start it. The app is configured to listen for the extension pop-up and automatically connect to it when it opens.

### Build commands

```shell
# Build Chrome distribution version
npm run build

# Build Firefox distribution version
npm run build:firefox
```

Build output dir is `/dist/`
