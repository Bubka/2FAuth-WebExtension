## Development

### Requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.com)
- [NPM](https://npmjs.com)

### Install js dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

### Dev build

The extension uses the [Vite Plugin Web Extension](https://vite-plugin-web-extension.aklinker1.io/).
It allows Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and a watch mode, cross-browser compatibility for the manifest file, automatic browser startup and more.

Simply run `npm run dev` in a terminal to launch a new browser and start working on the extension.

#### Enable vue devTools

The standalone [@vue/devtools](https://devtools.vuejs.org/) app comes as an npm dev dependency. Run `./node_modules/.bin/vue-devtools` in a terminal to start it. The app is configured to listen for the extension pop-up and automatically connect to it when it opens.

### Distribution builds

# Build all distribution versions
npm run dist
