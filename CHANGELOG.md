# Change log

## [1.1.0] - 2025-04-07

### Added

- A user preference to enable precalculation and display of the next OTP code.  
  Don't be surprised if you don't see the next code right after enabling this option, the code fades in slowly in order to maintain good readability of the current code.
- The extension now starts searching as soon as the user starts typing, without having to explicitly give focus to the search field

### Changed

- The user preferences enforced by the server administrator (thanks to 2FAuth v5.5.0) are now applied to the extension

### Fixed

- [issue #453](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/453), [issue #459](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/459) Various errors that caused the extension to remain locked
